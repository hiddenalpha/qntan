Qntan - A C module separations framework
========================================




## About the Name Qntan

Speak: "Q-en-tan".

It is short for "Quantum entanglement". It was chosen because this
projects wants to provide a separation (as in code modularization). But
the modules still are connected to their implementation (in a loose way
of course. Aka loose-coupling).

Sure, there's a lot of code with this in mind. The name is not meant to
assert that this is the only project in existence trying to do this.
It's just because, yes, it should have a name. That's it.
